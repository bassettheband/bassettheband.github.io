                                Basset is a contemporary folk group made up of Yasmine Shelton, Sam
                                Clark, and brothers Aaron and Noah Philipp-Muller. The quartet’s
                                innovative sound reflects their interest in the way acoustic folk
                                music evolves, with original songs that recall both the very recent
                                and the very old. Shelton’s mesmerizing voice leads the way,
                                supported by tight arrangements, inventive lyrics, and the odd
                                bluegrass turnaround on a mandolin or cello. In performance, the
                                group endear themselves to audiences with their down-to-earth
                                approach and habit of gently harrassing each other on stage, and
                                have earned humbling comparisons to influences Crooked Still and the
                                Punch Brothers.

                                The band met as students at the University of Toronto, and developed
                                their sound in its vibrant community of student artists before
                                moving on to perform across the city and beyond, sharing stages with
                                NEFE, The Lifers, Kunle, Fork n’ Harp, and others. In addition to
                                many performances at the university, they have played shows at the
                                Painted Lady, Hart House, and Lee’s Palace, and perform frequently
                                through the Toronto chapter of Artery, an organization of performers
                                and hosts around the city. Basset recently made their festival debut
                                as Youth Showcase Performers at Summerfolk in Owen Sound, and are
                                currently in the early stages of their debut EP.
